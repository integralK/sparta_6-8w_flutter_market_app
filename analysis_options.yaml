# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # 모든 경고를 비활성화할 수 있습니다.
    # 아래와 같이 추가해주면 경고 메시지가 표시되지 않습니다.
    # 참고: 이렇게 하면 경고는 안 보이지만 밑줄은 그대로 유지됩니다.
    # 예시 (경고를 끄는 방법):
    # prefer_const_constructors: false
    # 필요한 경고를 하나씩 비활성화할 수 있습니다.
# 여기에 경고를 숨기는 설정을 추가하면 됩니다.
# avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
# prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
